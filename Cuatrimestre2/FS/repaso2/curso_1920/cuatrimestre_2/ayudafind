       That command is of course not going to work.  Instead of doing things this  way,
       you should enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard:
       $ find . -name '*.c' -print
       $ find . -name \*.c -print

BUGS
       There  are  security  problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard
       specifies for find, which therefore cannot be fixed.   For  example,  the  -exec
       action  is inherently insecure, and -execdir should be used instead.  Please see
       Finding Files for more information.

       The environment variable LC_COLLATE has no effect on the -ok action.

       The  best  way  to  report  a  bug  is  to  use  the   form   at   http://savan‚Äê
       nah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils.  The reason for this is that you will then be
       able to track progress in fixing the problem.   Other comments about find(1) and
       about  the findutils package in general can be sent to the bug-findutils mailing
       list.  To join the list, send email to bug-findutils-request@gnu.org.
